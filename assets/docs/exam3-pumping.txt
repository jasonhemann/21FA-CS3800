Let L = { 0ⁱ1ʲ0ⁱ | i ≤ j }. We use the pumping lemma to show that L is
not a CFL. Firstly, we assume (temporarily, for this proof, to obtain
a contradiction) that L is a CFL. Let p be the pumping length given by
the context-free pumping lemma.

We will show that a string s ∈ L cannot be pumped. 

We choose the string s to be YOU FILL IN HERE, again where p is the
pumping length.

From our temporary assumption that L is a CFL, it follows that since s
is in L, s should be pumpable. That is, the pumping lemma says that we
can divide s into uvxyz, where |vxy| < p and |vy| > 0. However, we
show here that no matter how we divide s into uvxyz, one of the
conditions of the pumping lemma is violated.

YOU FILL IN HERE





Because each case results in a contradiction, a contradiction is
inevitable. So the assumption that L is a CFL must be false. Thus we
have proved that L is not context free.
