Submit the solution to this assignment in Gradescope.

The submission must include the following files (**NOTE**: everything is
case-sensitive):

  * `run-hw4-flip`

* a `README` containing the required information,

* the source code files needed by your `Makefile`,

## 1. Concatenation

**Your Task**

Implement concatenation for your NFAs from the previous assignment.

Specifically, write a function that, given:

* an NFA recognizing language $A\_1$, and

* an NFA recognizing language $A\_2$

returns an NFA recognizing $A\_1 \circ A\_2$.

* **Example**:

  You can test your program with these files:

  * [`nfa-a.xml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/nfa-a.xml): recognizes the language $\{"a"\}$

  * [`nfa-b.xml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/nfa-b.xml): recognizes the language $\{"b"\}$

* `Makefile` **target name**: `run-hw4-concat`

* **Example**:

  `printf "nfa-a.xml nfa-b.xml" | make -sf Makefile run-hw4-concat`

```

<transition><from>5</from><to>5</to><read>a</read></transition>
<transition><from>5</from><to>5</to><read>b</read></transition>
</automaton>
```

To do this, you’ll need to be able to extract individual components of
an NFA instance, e.g., the states, transitions, etc., and use them to
create a new NFA.

Figure 1.48 from the textbook should be helpful here.

**NOTE**: When combining NFAs **be careful with duplicate state
names**. Since the given files may use the same state names, it may be
a good idea to first rename them to something unique. Notice also how
the JFLAP format distinguishes $\epsilon$ transitions from transitions
on symbols of the alphabet.


## 2. Kleene Star

**Your Task**

Implement the Kleene Star operation for your NFAs from the last
assignment.

Specifically, write a function that, given an NFA recognizing language
$A$, returns an NFA recognizing $A^\*$.

To do this, you’ll need to be able to extract individual components of
an NFA instance, e.g., the states, transitions, etc., and use them to
create a new NFA.

Figure 1.50 from the textbook should be helpful here.

* `Makefile` **target name**: `run-hw4-kleene`

* **Example**:

  `printf "nfa-abc.xml" | make -sf Makefile run-hw4-kleene`

## 3. A Regular Expression Matcher

This problem will show you that you’ve almost implemented (the core of)
a regular expression matcher, which is found in nearly every programming
language! Congrats!

> The regexp matcher included with most PLs are of course much more
> efficient, and have many more bells and whistles than the
> theoretical models we are studying. But the basic behavior is indeed
> the same.

To complete it, you’ll just need use your NFA datastructure from HW3, in
combination with the union, concatenation, and Kleene star operations
you implemented so far.

You will also need the definition (Def 1.52) of Regular Expressions from
the textbook, which are defined using exactly these three operations:

R is a _regular expression_ if R is either:

* $a$ for some $a \in \Sigma$ (an alphabet),

* the empty string $\varepsilon$,

* the empty set $\emptyset$,

* $R\_1 \cup R\_2$, sometimes written $R\_1\mid R\_2$, where $R\_1$ and $R\_2$
  are regular expressions,

* $R\_1 \circ R\_2$, sometimes written $R\_1R\_2$, where $R\_1$ and $R\_2$ are
  regular expressions,

* $R\_1^\*$, where $R\_1$ is a regular expression.

**Your Task**

Use Lemma 1.55 and the NFA-closed operations you’ve implemented to
create an equivalent NFA for each of the regular expressions below
(these are all from Example 1.53 in the textbook).

Assume that $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$, a $^+$ means "1 or more", and a $\Sigma$ in a
regular expression below means $0\cup 1$.

* $0^\*10^\* = \{w \mid w \textrm{ contains a single } 1\}$

* $\Sigma^\*001\Sigma^\* = \{w \mid w \textrm{ contains the string } 001 \textrm{ as a substring}\}$

* $1^\*(01^+)^\* = \{w \mid \textrm{every } 0 \textrm{ in } w \textrm{ is followed by at least one } 1\}$

* $\(\Sigma\Sigma\Sigma\)^\* = \{w \mid \textrm{the length of } w \textrm{ is a multiple of } 3\}$

* $0\Sigma^\*0\cup 1\Sigma^\*1\cup 0\cup 1 = \{w\mid w \textrm{ starts and ends with the same symbol}\}$

* $\(0\cup\varepsilon\)1^\* = 01^\*\cup1^\*$

* $\(0\cup\varepsilon\)\(1\cup\varepsilon\) = \{\varepsilon,0,1,01\}$

* $1^\*\emptyset = \emptyset$

<!-- stars indicate moved, two nums indicate new numbering, old numbering -->
<!-- 1 1  * $0^\*10^\* = \{w \mid w \textrm{ contains a single } 1\}$ --> 
<!-- *2 * $\Sigma^\*1\Sigma^\* = \{w \mid w \textrm{ has at least one } 1\}$ -->
<!-- 2 3 * $\Sigma^\*001\Sigma^\* = \{w \mid w \textrm{ contains the string } 001 \textrm{ as a substring}\}$ -->
<!-- 3 4 * $1^\*(01^+)^\* = \{w \mid \textrm{every } 0 \textrm{ in } w \textrm{ is followed by at least one } 1\}$ -->
<!--*5 * $\(\Sigma\Sigma\)^\* = \{w \mid w \textrm{ is a string of even length}\}$ -->
<!--4 6 * $\(\Sigma\Sigma\Sigma\)^\* = \{w \mid \textrm{the length of } w \textrm{ is a multiple of } 3\}$ -->
<!--*7 * $01 \cup 10 = \{01,10\}$ -->
<!--5 8 * $0\Sigma^\*0\cup 1\Sigma^\*1\cup 0\cup 1 = \{w\mid w \textrm{ starts and ends with the same symbol}\}$ -->
<!--6 9 * $\(0\cup\varepsilon\)1^\* = 01^\*\cup1^\*$ -->
<!--7 10 * $\(0\cup\varepsilon\)\(1\cup\varepsilon\) = \{\varepsilon,0,1,01\}$ -->
<!--  *11 * $1^\*\emptyset = \emptyset$ -->
<!--8 12 * $\emptyset^\* = \{\varepsilon\}$ -->

Each NFA you create is doing exactly the same thing as a real regexp
matcher! To prove this to you, the grader will test your submission
using the regexp implementation from an actual PL (e.g., could be Perl,
Python, Java, Racket, etc.).

Specifically, your solution will be tested as follows:

* **Input** (from `stdin`): a number, from 1 to 8 (inclusive),
  corresponding to one of the regular expression examples from above

* Expected **Output** (to `stdout`): An XML automaton element
  representing an NFA that recognizes the same language as the regular
  expression corresponding to the input number. Though they should
  recognize the same language, our grader will only check strings up
  to length at most eight. We will expect you to complete all 8, even
  though we will only check four of them. Which four we check/allocate
  points for is randomly selected after the final submissions.

  To be considered correct, **this NFA must have been constructed from
  smaller NFAs using union, concat, and star as described in Lemma
  1.55**. We will inspect your source code to ensure this.

  To further illustrate what I mean, here is a snippet of (Racket) code
  from our sample solution:

```racket
  ;; Part of our sample solution, to illustrate what you should do

  (define N0 (mk-single-char-nfa "0")) ; NFA recognizing {"0"}
  (define N1 (mk-single-char-nfa "1")) ; NFA recognizing {"1"}
  (define N0* (nfa* N0)) ; NFA recognizing {"", "0", "00", "000", ...}

  (case (read-stdin)
    ["1" (nfa->xml (nfa-concat (nfa-concat N0* N1) N0*))]
    ....)
```

* `Makefile` **target name**: `run-hw4-regexp`

* **Example**:

  `printf "1" | make -sf Makefile run-hw4-regexp`

  Output:

```

  <transition><from>6</from><to>7</to><read>0</read></transition>
  <transition><from>7</from><to>6</to><read/></transition>
  </automaton>
```

**More Hints:**

To further help you, below are the exact regexp patterns (each
corresponds to a numbered example from above) that the grader will use
to grade your output NFA (the grader will only check strings up to
length at most eight).

Note that in typical regexp matching, a union of single chars, e.g.,
$0 \cup 1$, is typically written `[01]`, while the "vertical bar"
$\mid$ is a more general union operation.

* `"0*10*"`

* `"[01]*001[01]*"`

* `"1*(01+)*"`

* `"([01][01][01])*"`

* `"01*|1*"`

* `"^$|^0$|^1$|^01$"`

  \(won’t work without the `^` or `$`, which stand for "string start"
  and "string end", respectively, demonstrating that there ​_are_​ some
  differences between the theoretical regular expressions we study in
  class, and the regexp matching available in programming languages)

* `"[^[01]*]"` (a pattern that won’t match anything)

<!-- * `"0*10*"` -->
<!-- * `"[01]*1[01]*"` -->
<!-- * `"[01]*001[01]*"` -->
<!-- * `"1*(01+)*"` -->
<!-- * `"([01][01])*"` -->
<!-- * `"([01][01][01])*"` -->
<!-- * `"01|10"` -->
<!-- * `"0[01]*0|1[01]*1|0|1"` -->
<!-- * `"01*|1*"` -->
<!-- * `"^$|^0$|^1$|^01$"` -->

<!--   \(won’t work without the `^` or `$`, which stand for "string start" -->
<!--   and "string end", respectively, demonstrating that there ​_are_​ some -->
<!--   differences between the theoretical regular expressions we study in -->
<!--   class, and the regexp matching available in programming languages) -->

<!-- * `"\b\B"` (pattern that won’t match anything) -->

<!-- * `""` -->

With these, you should be able to easily test your solution on your
own using the regexp library in your favorite language. Make sure to
choose "exact match" ("partial match" is the default in some langs and
will not recognize the same language), which corresponds to the
textbook’s notion of matching. Specifically, for any given string in
the language of alphabet $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ (up to length at most
eight), your NFA should accept the string **if and only if** the
equivalent regexp pattern matches on the string.

Finally, if you still need more explanations, the internet has plenty
of sites dedicated to learning about, and interactively exploring
regexps, e.g., [regexr.com](https://regexr.com/) or
[regex101.com](https://regex101.com/). The Emacs [`xr`
package](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/xr.html), for instance, will
translate regular expressions back to a human-readable format, and
also let you lint your regular expressions.

## 4. The FLIP Operation

Define the $\textrm{FLIP}$ operation on a language to be:

$\textrm{FLIP}(L) = \{c\_n \ldots c\_0 \mid c\_0\ldots c\_n \in L\}, \textrm{where } c\_i \in \Sigma$

Prove that regular languages are closed under the \textrm{FLIP}
operation by reading in the name of an XML file containing an XML
automaton element describing a DFA and producing an XML automaton
element representing an NFA that recognizes a flipped version of the
language recognized by the machine from the input. We will test your
machine by running it against a variety of outputs.

* **Example**:

  You can test your program with these files:

  * [`dfa-abc.xml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/dfa-abc.xml): recognizes the language $\{"abc"\}$


* `Makefile` **target name**: `run-hw4-flip`

* **Example**:

  `printf "dfa-abc.xml" | make -sf Makefile run-hw4-flip`
